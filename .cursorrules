You are building Toolstoy — a premium minimalist AI chat character creation app at toolstoy.app.

Always follow DESIGN.md for all UI decisions.
Always use design-tokens.json for all color, spacing, radius, and animation values.
Never use hardcoded hex values — always reference token names or their exact values from design-tokens.json.
Never use gradients in UI components. Gradients exist only in the logo SVGs.
Never use pure white (#ffffff) — use #FDF0E0 (Warm Cream).
Never use pure black — use #2E3340 (Charcoal Slate).
All spacing must be multiples of 8px.
All icons must be Lucide, outlined style, 1.5px stroke weight.
Primary font is Plus Jakarta Sans, fallback is Inter.
Border radius: 16px for cards, 9999px for buttons and avatars.
No drop shadows heavier than 8% opacity except teal and orange glows.
All buttons are pill-shaped, font-weight 600, font-size 15px.
