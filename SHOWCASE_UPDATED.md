# Showcase Cards - Now Filled with Real Content! ✨

## What Was Updated

### 1. Showcase Cards (Homepage)
Replaced placeholder "Character Name" and "Product Type" with 7 unique, compelling characters:

| Layout | Character | Product | Personality |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Side by Side | **Max** | Wireless Headphones | Tech-savvy audio expert |
| Character Top | **Luna** | Skincare Serum | Science-focused beauty advisor |
| Chat Focus | **Atlas** | Travel Backpack | Experienced world traveler |
| Mirror | **Sage** | Smart Home Hub | Patient tech guide |
| Immersive | **Nova** | Gaming Keyboard | Serious gaming enthusiast |
| Compact | **Finn** | Coffee Maker | No-nonsense coffee purist |
| Cinematic | **Echo** | Electric Bike | Eco-conscious commuter |

### 2. Demo Modal Content
Each character now has:
- **Unique greeting** that matches their personality
- **Two detailed responses** with real product specs
- **Authentic voice** - not generic AI responses

## Example Character: Max (Wireless Headphones)

**Greeting:**
> "Hey! I'm Max. These headphones? They're not just audio gear — they're your personal sound studio."

**Response 1:**
> "40-hour battery. Active noise cancellation that actually works. And they fold flat — no bulky case needed."

**Response 2:**
> "IPX4 water-resistant. Sweat won't kill them. Rain won't either. They're built for real life."

## Why This Matters

- Generic "Character Name" placeholders
